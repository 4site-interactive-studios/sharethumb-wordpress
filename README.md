# sharethumb-wordpress
Wordpress Plugin for ShareThumb - Automated social media share images for your website

After installation, update the settings page at /wp-admin/admin.php?page=sharethumb.  You can find your API Key and Domain Validation key at https://app.sharethumb.io/dashboard. Any changes to the settings page will update your settings in your ShareThumb account.

You can optionally override the settings for individual content.  You can find the override settings in the right sidebar when editing the content.  If the sidebar override settings do not appear, ensure you have enabled overrides for that post type on the main settings page.
